# Putting the Algebra in Data Types

- What is an Algebra in Mathematics?
  - Symbols (0,1,2,3,x,y,z ...)
  - Operations (+, -,*, / ...)
  - Laws (associativity, commutativity, identity ...)

  a + b = b + a

- How does it relate to Computing?
  - Symbols (Things)
  - Operations(Ways to combine things to make other things)
  - Laws (Rules the things should follow)

  ---

  - Symbols (Unit, Bool, Int ...)
  - Operations (addition, multiplication, exponent)
  - Laws (associativity, commutativity, identity ...)

--- what are the laws of addition?
- Associativity
- Commutativity
- Identity (left and right)

--- what are the laws of multiplication?
- Associativity
- Commutativity
- Identity (left and right)
- Distribution

--- what are the laws of exponent?
- x ^ 0 = 1
- x ^ 1 = x
x-1 = 1/x
x ^ m * x ^ n = x^ (m+n)
(xy) ^ n = x^ n * y ^ n


Cardinality

> The number possible values of a data type

Void (0)

Unit (1)
()

Bool (2)
True | False

Int (2^32 ~ 4B)

String (2^32 - 1 ~ 2B * 2^16)
* Complete works of William Shakespear has 884,647 words


Sum Types

data ThreeState = Checked | Unchecked | Unknown

What is the Cardinality?

Checked (1) | Unchecked (1) | Unknown (1)
= 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

data Direction = North | East | South | West

What is the Cardinality?

North (1) | East (1) | South (1) | West (1)
= 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

- Just add the Cardinality of each constructors (Nullary vs Unary vs others)

Product Types
data Direction = North | East | South | West

data Speed = Slow | Fast

data Velocity = Velocity { direction :: Direction,  speed :: Speed }

possible values:

Velocity North Fast
Velocity North Slow
Velocity East Fast
Velocity East Slow
Velocity South Fast
Velocity South Slow
Velocity West Fast
Velocity West Slow
= 8

Speed = Slow (1) | Fast (1)
= 2

Direction = North (1) | East (1) | South (1) | West (1)
= 4

Size of a product type = multiplication of the Cardinality of component types
= 2 * 4
= 8

Uses of Cardinality

- Finding Isomorphisms
  - Same information (possibly different structures), reversible
  - Two different types with the same Cardinality can represent the same data without losing information
- Reducing the possible values to consider (easier to reason about)

* Leave out null and Exceptions
